Project Title:
ESP32 Ultrasonic Distance Measurement with Web Server

Project Description:

In this project, we will leverage the capabilities of the ESP32 microcontroller to create a versatile distance measurement system using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. Our goal is to accurately measure distances in three different units (centimeters, inches, and meters) and display the results on an LCD screen.

Components Used:

ESP32 Dev Module Microcontroller.
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor.
Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) with I2C Interface.
Various LEDs and a Buzzer for Alerting.
breadboard and jumper cables.
Project Overview:

1. Hardware Setup:

Connect the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to the ESP32 microcontroller.
Set up the LCD display for showing distance measurements.
Configure LEDs and a buzzer for visual and auditory alerts.
2. Distance Measurement:

Utilize the HC-SR04 sensor to accurately measure distances in centimeters using ultrasonic waves.
Convert these measurements into inches and meters for added convenience.
3. Real-Time Display:

Display the distance measurements in real-time on the LCD screen.
The LCD will show the distance in centimeters, inches, and meters.
4. Alert System:

Implement an alert system based on distance thresholds.
Visual alerts will be given through LEDs, with different LEDs lighting up for different proximity levels.
Auditory alerts will be provided using a buzzer.
5. Local Web Server:

Configure the ESP32 to act as a local web server.
Access the distance measurements and alerts via a web browser.
Use the GET and POST protocols to interact with the web server.
Project Benefits:

Versatile Distance Measurement: This project offers distance measurements in three different units, making it suitable for various applications.
Real-Time Monitoring: Users can monitor distance measurements in real-time via the LCD display and a web interface.
Alert System: The system provides alerts for different distance ranges, enhancing safety and awareness.
Local Web Server: The local web server allows for remote monitoring and control of the system.

This ESP32-based distance measurement and web server project showcases the capabilities of the ESP32 microcontroller and provides a practical solution for applications such as home automation, robotics, and security systems.
